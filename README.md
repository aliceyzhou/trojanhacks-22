# Code Tetris

This game tests your ability to program under pressure! When the game begins, two users are sent head to head to code a solution to the problem as quickly as possible. However, the other user can also send bugs to interfere, hiding the screen's text, freezing the screen, or even converting your semicolons to colons!

This program is built with React, Javascript, websocket, Netlify, and Heroku
